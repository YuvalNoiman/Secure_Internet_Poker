Everyone contributed to everthing adding to the code and the written document

To run the code open three terminals. 

In each terminal cd to this folder (Secure_Internet_Poker). 

Once all three folders have access to the folder on the first terminal type python3 -m house. 

In the second terminal type python3 -m player 1. In the third terminal type python3 -m player 2. 

From there just follow the instructions in the player terminal and follow along.
